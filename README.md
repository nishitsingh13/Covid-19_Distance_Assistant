Social distancing is a method used to control the spread of contagious diseases. It implies that people physically distance themselves from one another, reducing close contact, and thereby reducing the spread of a contagious disease (such as the COVID-19 Disease). Social distancing is not a new concept, dating back to the fifth century, and has even been referenced in religious text such as the Bible.
